# rbb data styleguide

This is our styleguide that builds on a couple of basic principles that we have developed.

* We design and code for mobile devices first and make no compromise, when it comes to this.

* We want to guide our readers through the stories, so we have a clear path of how interactives as well as static graphics should function.

* We want to create graphics and interactives that suck you in. That means on the first glance, the story must be clear and it should not be too complicated. And secondly, people should want to stay and explore. Squint-test.
