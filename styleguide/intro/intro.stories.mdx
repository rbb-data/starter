# rbb data style guide

<b>Mission: Precise but playful, data but personal</b>

We want to create evidence-based visual journalism with our work being rooted in data and research. Yet, we also want to make our users feel something. Because we believe that there is an advantage in learning and debating, if emotional and cognitive thinking come together.


Following this mission, our style guide builds on a couple of basic principles that we have developed.



1. <b> Mobile first</b> We design and code for mobile devices first and make no compromise, when it comes to this.

* This means we use vertical formats, not more than 2 side-by-side comparison, we always consider what can be seen on the first screen

* We also try out things that only work on mobiles. Interaction designs where you have to shake the device, swipe, use its GPS sensors etc.

2. <b>Smooth but sticky</b> All graphics and interactives have a clear architecture, a well-defined flow. Still, people should get stuck in our work.  Not because we messed up â€“ but because our work has multiple layers. We can define it as 1-1-1 rule.
* Get an idea in the 1st second: We have headlines that explain the graphic/interactive right away and also give a condensed analysis. // Simple subtitles // Graphics/interactives are reduced to the core message // We use less rather than more colours 
* 1 interaction is enough to get to the next point: One swipe leads to the next information // We do not want back and forth scrolling, clicking to be necessary by design 
* We want readers to stick with us for 1 minute: In the best case scenario, people discover more and more layers to a graphic/interactive // There must be a clear storytelling for this to happen.
